I’m an incoming junior at Brown University studying computer science and philosophy. My interests include operating systems, distributed systems, networks, web development, and technology journalism/policy.

### Internship Experience :computer:

🖥️ **Microsoft** — I’m currently a PM intern in the Azure for Operators division. I work on Azure Programmable Connectivity, a service that abstracts away the complexity of network APIs behind a convenient interface. 

:earth_africa: **NASA** — Previously, I was a SWE intern at NASA GSFC, where I developed a REST API that gave scientists easy access to an earth systems model running in AWS. 

### Research and Teaching 📚

At Brown, I’m an undergraduate researcher in the [ETOS group](https://etos.cs.brown.edu/index.html). I contribute to soft memory, a software-level abstraction on top of primary storage that makes memory revocable from lower-priority processes when a machine faces memory pressure. This memory is then reallocated to latency-critical processes, which prevents crashes and—by extension—reduces memory underutilization in data centers. 

Also at Brown, I’ve worked as a teaching assistant for two of my favorite courses, Data Structures & Algorithms (spring 2024) and Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (fall 2023, 2024). 

### Writing 📝

I'm a freelance writer and current contributer to The Brown Daily Herald, Brown University’s independent student newspaper. Some favorite articles I’ve written include a [BDH article](https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2023/04/u-fli-students-discuss-challenges-financial-obstructions-to-studying-abroad) on Brown’s lack of financial aid to low-income students studying abroad and a [Business Insider feature](https://www.businessinsider.com/art-historians-experts-artists-think-nfts-2021-4) on what art historians think of NFTs.
