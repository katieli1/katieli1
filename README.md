I’m an incoming senior at Brown University studying computer science and philosophy. My interests include operating systems, distributed systems, full-stack web development, and tech ethics. 

### Internship Experience :computer:

🖥️ **Microsoft** — SWE intern for [Microsoft Discovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/transforming-rd-with-agentic-ai-introducing-microsoft-discovery/) (summer 2025), TPM intern for Azure for Operators (summer 2024)

:earth_africa: **NASA** — SWE intern at GSFC (summer 2023)

### Research and Teaching 📚

At Brown, I’m an undergraduate researcher in the [ETOS group](https://etos.cs.brown.edu/index.html). I contribute to soft memory, a software-level abstraction on top of primary storage that makes memory revocable from lower-priority processes when a machine faces memory pressure. This memory is then reallocated to latency-critical processes, which prevents crashes and reduces memory underutilization in data centers. 

Also at Brown, I’ve been a teaching assistant for two of my favorite courses, Data Structures & Algorithms (spring 2024, head TA in spring 2025) and Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (fall 2023, fall 2024, fall 2025).
